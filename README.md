# Project_3

## _The What:_

We propose an app for pet friendly places.  This will be user generated data.  Along with creating a React App, we will be creating an API.  

## _The Why:_

Currently, there is not a realiable source of information for pet friendly places.  We wish to fill that information gap.

## _The How:_

The React App will allow users to sign up/log in, check-in, and push "votes" about a place that is cross referenced with a google maps address.  The API will implement keys and serve up/interact with the generated data.

## _The Team:_

Danielle: Front End, Making a pretty pretty thing.

Alicia: Middlware, The Glue the holds us together.

Jason: Back End/API, Making it go boom.

## _The UI:_
